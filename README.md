# Overview

This repository is created for solving neetcode(leetcode) problems. I usually use main.js to write code for each problems. some problems in neetcode practice have leetcode problems which is for only premium users. In order to fix the problems, I use LintCode that is similar to LeetCode but We can see problems for free although same problems in Leet Code is not available for free users.
